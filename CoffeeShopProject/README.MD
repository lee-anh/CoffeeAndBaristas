<h1>Coffee and Baristas</h1>

The purpose of this project is to decide how many cashiers (baristas) to hire at a certain coffee shop in order to optimize the profit through event-driven simulation. An event-driven simulation is where the program processes events as they come, advancing the current time only when there is an event (Weiss). The event-driven simulation is implemented through the use of data structures like ArrayList, LinkedList, ArrayDeque, Queue, and Priority Queue. The LinkedList and the ArrayDeque (a circular array) are implemented through the Queue interface and their performances are compared. The data from the coffee shop to be analyzed are taken and read from a given input file.

This project was created for my CS 150 Data Structures and Algorithms Course that I took in Fall 2020 at Lafayette College
